<h1>About me </h1>

<h3>Who am i ?</h3>
Hi there, My Name is Keshav Hasija.


I am a Self-Taught Hacker, Who is watching all over the Internet.

I started my Cyber Security journey in my Second Year of my College, I was keen interested in Hacking but Didn't knew where to start. I learnt the Basics of IT.

Then After clearing my Basics, I started doing CTFs from Tryhackme and HacktheBox. At first, I got stuck and didn't understood anythings, How to Capture the Flag. How these things work but I started watching walkthroughs, thereafter I learned about doing Penetesting. At that time, I was not into much coding but yeah I was keen interested in developing projects.

Therefore, I did some Internships during my College Time, where they taught me about finding and exploiting the web vulnerabilities.

After finishing my Bachelor's, I gave my CEH ( Certified Ethical Hacker ) Exam, and I passed it with great grades 🎉.


<h3>Professional Experiences</h3>

I am a VAPT Analyst, who performs Penetration Testing, where I find vulnerabilities in Web Applications, Networks, and Systems.
